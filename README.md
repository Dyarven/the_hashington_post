# the_hashington_post
The Hashington Post is a dynamic website made with PHP and MySQL about cybersecurity news and updates on the most popular operative systems used in pentesting and auditing.
Most of the content is, however, just a sample as the project was made while I was practicing my PHP and MySQL skills and not with commercial purposes or any other usages in mind.
I just threw it in here, it hasn't been branched with future releases in mind or anything. In case you want to check it out you can do it quickly with a LAMPP stack.
