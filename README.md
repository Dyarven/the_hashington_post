# the_hashington_post
The Hashington Post is a dynamic website made with PHP and MySQL about cybersecurity news and updates on the most popular operative systems used in pentesting and auditing.
Most of the content is, however, just a sample as the project was made for learning PHP and MySQL and not with commercial purposes in mind or any other related uses.
